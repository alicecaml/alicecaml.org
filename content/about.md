# About

Iâ€™m one of the core developers of the [Dune build system](https://github.com/ocaml/dune)
for my day job. Dune is a mature and widely used OCaml build system which it
difficult to make large structural changes to its UI and packaging
philosophy. Alice is an experiment exploring the design space of OCaml
build systems when these constraints are lifted.

The name Alice comes from an [Australian children's song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM7Jnetdf0I).
