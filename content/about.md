# About

Alice is my toy build-system project and is intended as an experiment and not a
production-ready tool.

Iâ€™m one of the core developers of the [Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune)
build system for my day job. Dune is a mature and widely used OCaml build
system and package manager which makes it difficult to affect large structural
changes to its UI and packaging philosophy. Alice is an experiment exploring
the design space of OCaml build systems when these constraints are lifted.

The name Alice comes from an [Australian children's song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM7Jnetdf0I).
