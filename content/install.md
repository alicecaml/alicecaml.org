# Install

## Installing Alice

Alice is still in the early stages of development so no install script or system
packages are available yet. If you want to try it out there are some options.

### Build from Source

Alice is a Dune project (for now at least until it can build itself!). Its
source code is [here](https://github.com/alicecaml/alice). Read the README file
for notes on how best to build the project.

### Binary Releases

Download the latest binary package from Alice's [releases
page](https://github.com/alicecaml/alice/releases). After extracting, add the
`bin` directory from the package to your `PATH` variable to make the `alice`
command runnable in your shell.


## Shell Completions

Alice can generate its own completion scripts (currently just for `bash`):
```
$ alice internal completions bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Completion script for alice. Generated by climate.
...
```

Put this script in a file and `source` it from your shell to enable Alice's
shell completions. For example:

```
$ mkdir -p ~/.alice
$ alice internal completions bash > ~/.alice/completions.sh
```

Then add the following to your `~/.bashrc`:
```
source ~/.alice/completions.sh
```

In new shells you'll be able to complete `alice` commands. E.g.:
```
$ alice <TAB>
build     dot       internal  run
clean     help      new       tools
```
